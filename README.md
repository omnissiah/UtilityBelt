# UtilityBelt
A small desktop app for common problems. C#.

Currently can do the following,

* **Pinger:** Made with an update server in mind. Tries to ping a host, reach update site and download the update package.
* **Base64 encoder/decoder:** Converts everything to base 64 format and back and save as a file if necessary.
* **Rtf to text converter:** Converts plain text to Rtf format. Works both ways.
